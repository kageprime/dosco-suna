/**
 * Inbound Slack and Teams webhooks: claim, ack, work. Telegram and Email store
 * each event before the ack instead (integrations/event-inbox.ts).
 *
 * A webhook handler claims its event in `chat_event_dedup` so a provider retry
 * does not run it twice, then acks 200 and works on. If the work fails, the
 * claim must not outlive it: the provider's retry (Slack) would find
 * the claim held and drop the event. This module records every claim a handler
 * takes, in an async scope, and releases them all when the work fails.
 *
 * The ack waits up to `ACK_WAIT_MS` for the work. A fast failure answers 500, so
 * the provider retries; slow work answers 200 and finishes in the background.
 * Either way the work is registered with the shutdown drain (`shared/drain.ts`),
 * so a deploy waits for it instead of cutting it.
 *
 * Slow work is loud: when the ack budget elapses the log names the work's
 * stage split (`dbMs`, `httpMs`) so a p95 rise on a webhook route attributes
 * to DB stalls, outbound (Slack) latency, or handler compute without tracing
 * (KRTX-4015: with no line here a >2s work was invisible — the request log
 * shows only "2002ms").
 *
 * A failure that lands AFTER the ack went out is different from one before it:
 * the provider got its 2xx and will not redeliver, so releasing the claim alone
 * loses the event. A route that needs the event to survive passes `onFailure`
 * and checks `acked` — the Slack event routes use it to enqueue a durable
 * redelivery on the job queue (integrations/event-inbox.ts machinery);
 * interactivity and Teams keep their 500-retry window and pass nothing.
 * `claimsReleased` says whether the dedup claim actually freed: when it did
 * not, a replay scheduled now would find the claim held and skip, so the
 * scheduler must wait the claim out first.
 *
 * A background caller that must not complete while the work runs (the redelivery
 * job: a completed job is never retried) passes `awaitSettlement`: the call
 * then resolves to the work's settled outcome every way it ends — the timer,
 * a late failure, a fast failure — and only after the failed path's claim
 * release and `onFailure` hook finished. A settlement caller therefore always
 * reads the hook's effect (whoever scheduled the redelivery set it) intact;
 * a rushed one would retry the job on a claim that is still live.
 *
 * Not covered: a crash (OOM, SIGKILL) while the work runs. The claim then holds
 * until it expires, and the event is lost.
